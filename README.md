# Digital Transformation in Manufacturing
I presented at Splunk's .conf18 in Orlando, FL demonstrating our use case of breaking traditional thought regarding technology migrations in manufacturing by implementing the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) in legacy industrial control systems.

## Abstract
Manufacturing pros everywhere, rejoice! You can enable automated machine learning to manage continuous maintenance monitoring and enable predictive maintenance with the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit without costly and disruptive technology migrations. Manufacturing lines are a plethora of valuable information, but what is the best approach to extraction and action? Static control limits for performance indicators miss key elements in the overall health of an electromechanical system. Letâ€™s look at some situations where the Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit can generate knowledge and prompt decisions to keep industrial assets running longer without running to failure.
